In my 2nd year of college, I along with my 4 classmates worked on an idea wherein we wanted to aggregate street food in India. In fact, during our summer break rather than doing an internship, we preferred to pursue this idea. It turned out to be one of the most enriching experiences of our college lives. We all moved to New Delhi, rented a place and started approaching these famous street food joints. Eventually, we realised that the market is too fragmented and standardisation was also missing. This was a pivoting point for our project and we turned it around into an idea which ultimately was a winner. We realised that these eating places were themselves very famous and could be leveraged as outdoor media junctions which get great and quantifiable footfall unlike the conventional hoardings, buses etc which have limited engagement rate and are not measurable easily. This led us to create Gogappe, our summer project wherein we even tied up with 70 street food junctions in New Delhi and created a branding framework which we then pitched to various companies in India whose marketing strategies were more aligned towards guerilla or BTL methods. 

It was a great idea to work upon but due to other commitments and the idea being heavily operations driven, we had to shut it down. In this entire process, we all learned how to work together and what does it take to build a startup. Nonetheless, we participated with this idea in Business Plan Competition of our college (IIT Roorkee) and won the finalist award.
